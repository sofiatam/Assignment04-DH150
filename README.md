### Description of Project ###
##### Problem and Solution Overview #####
The main activity of this project is finding a restaurant to eat at online. The basic need involved for this activity is the internet. Currently, the solutions to satisfy this need are word-of-mouth and internet searches. There are various sites that exist to share restaurants, like Yelp, Google, and TripAdvisor. The limitations that could be improved with technology are that it is hard to refine and filter restaurants, since there are so many of them. There is also no usage of data to cater search results to match your historical preferences. The plethora of data is difficult to sort through.

##### Target Users #####
Target users actually span a large range of ages, since, in theory, all people need to eat. I would say the primary demographic of users is high schoolers to middle-aged adults (14 - 50). People who look for restaurants online are people who care about other people's opinions and the quality of food + experience. Users will typically search for restaurants in a location that they are less familiar with because they do not know what restaurants exist. Another reason people would look for restaurants is if trying to find a particular type of restaurant. To complete a restaurant search, users consult either the internet (sites such as Yelp) or trust word-of-mouth.

### Reflection ###
The interview process went as follows:
- determine problem and purpose of project
- prepare interview script by writing down questions of interest related to problem
- set up equipment (screen recording, video+audio recording, transcript technology)
- find an interviewee
- conduct interview
- take notes
- analysis

I learned that interviewing participants is really insightful to see how people interact with your product, first-hand. While time-consuming, it does provide useful data for product improvements. Since I, myself, am a Yelp user, it was interesting to see how someone else utilized this site. I learned that I go more in depth and spend more time on my searches than my interviewee, which indicates that perhaps I could be the one exhibiting unusual behavior. It is useful to eliminate all biases when performing these interviews to try and view the product from an outsider perspective. What went smoothly during the interview was that the technology and equipment set up was convenient, moving from section to section was natural, and the interviewee did a great job of speaking out loud. In the future, I would keep the interview more like a conversation rather than a formal interview, and I would ask more follow-up questions to ask about the reasoning behind my interviewee's decisions (focus on the WHY). The interview provided useful insights, and it helped me note areas of improvement for Yelp and the service it provides its users.
